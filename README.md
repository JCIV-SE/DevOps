### 1. What is devOps?
#### Definition.
  DevOps is an organization-wide approach to implementing continuous deployment in keeping with [agile principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/). The term comes from both "development" and "operations", as both the developers (software engineers) and IT operations department (devOps engineers) need to work together to deploy and re-deploy their products with optimum resiliency and frequency.
